# dms_db

Curated collection of Deep Mutational Scanning datasets for `phydms` analysis.   

## Data
#### Naming
The directories have the following naming scheme:   
`PROTEIN_YEAR_FIRSTAUTHOR`

#### Contents
##### README
Each directory will have a `README` with the following information:   
• Source (Title of paper)   
• Original datafile name from paper    
• Protein name   
• ID or directory name  
• Source ID or BibTex ID   
• Any notes  

There will also be a table.css file for the `HTML` mark-up of the `README` file.

#### `Citation.txt`
`BibTeX` citation

#### Preferences

#### Alignments
The directory will also contain large alignments which can be sampled for `phydms` analysis.
