Curated collection of Deep Mutational Scanning datasets to facilitate easy `phydms` analysis.   

## Data
#### Naming
The directories have the following naming scheme:   
`PROTEIN_FIRSTAUTHOR_YEAR`

####Contents
##### README
Each directory will have a read me with the following information:   
• Source (easily parsed for bibliographies)  
• Original file name  
• Protein name  
• Any notes
####Preferences
Each deep mutational dataset will be transformed into amino-acid preferences.  

####Alignments
The directory will also contain large alignments which can be sampled for `phydms` analysis.

## Other Files
